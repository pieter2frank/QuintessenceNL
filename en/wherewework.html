		        <h1 class="title">Where we work… (in which sectors)</h1>

          <p> Our services are not related to any specific area of the charity or non profit sector.  Our team of co-workers have a wide range of experience and where necessary we are able source other, external specialists.  We deliver efficient work with a minimum of expenses.  For example, by receiving expert advice only when this really necessary you save the trouble of investing in new staff or training of existing staff.  </p>
          <h2> International aid and disaster relief</h2>
          <p><img src="../images/sector1.png" alt="" width="116" height="75" align="left" /> In many parts of the world, standards of living are far lower than in the Netherlands or in the Western world.  Also, often we do not realise that this is equally the case in many countries within Europe.  Countries such as Ukraine or Moldova have a long way to go in terms improving the daily living conditions of its citizens.  Housing, sanitation, nutrition and food distribution and clean drinking water are but some of the issues requiring attention.  Other needs include projects to stimulate job creation, to support children’s homes and to set up sports and leisure resources.  Those among the poorest, the disabled and senior citizens are often in need of particular attention.  </p>
          <h2>Medical resources and support</h2>
          <p><img src="../images/sector2.png" alt="" width="116" height="75" align="left" /> For many people in the world medical resources are often still out of reach or unaffordable.  Providing support and access to sound medical equipment and skilled medical staff saves lives. Fortunately there are many organizations that focus on this particular area of humanitarian aid.  Besides providing treatment and other concrete forms of aid, there are also extensive programmes to supply medical equipment as well as provide vaccination and prevention strategies.  </p>
          <h2> Environmental management</h2>
          <p><img src="../images/sector3.png" alt="" width="116" height="75" align="left" /> Our world is increasingly experiencing pressure due to the growing need for natural resources.  Slowly but surely our planet’s natural resources are being exhausted.  Fortunately, there is an increasing awareness of these issues and the possibilities provided by alternative energy sources, such as solar, water and wind energy.  In the decades to come, these new energy sources will be crucial.  The protection of our planet’s ecosystems and endangered species are other topics requiring attention and awareness. </p>
          <h2> Micro finance</h2>
          <p><img src="../images/sector4.png" alt="" width="116" height="75" align="left" />Extending small credit loans can help people to build small business initiatives, to create jobs and to give themselves and others access to basic needs.  By encouraging self-sufficiency an entire community will be able to reap benefits and grow towards sustainability.  </p>
          <h2>            Reconstruction and development </h2>
          <p><img src="../images/sector5.png" alt="" width="116" height="75" align="left" />Across the world reconstruction and development projects are taking place in former war zones (Afghanistan, Iraq, etc.), disaster areas (parts of Africa and Asia), areas shattered by earthquakes (Haiti, Turkey, Italy) or by floods (Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, etc.).  At times, entire communities have to be rebuilt.  To this end, countless projects have been initiated with the support of international and local organizations and governments.  This picture of Bosnia Herzegovina shows that ten years after the end of the war large parts of the cities Mostar and Sarajevo are still in ruins.  </p>
          <h2> Disaster relief</h2>
          <p><img src="../images/sector6.png" alt="" width="116" height="75" align="left" />Our world is regularly faced with floods, earthquakes, and life threatening natural disasters.  Recent examples are Haiti, China and Pakistan.  In the first weeks immediately following a disaster, the need for clean drinking water and shelters, amongst others, is great.  Also, after the first basic aid has been provided, there remains a great need for longer term relief in various areas.  Careful coordination, transport and logistics are required to ensure this aid reaches those places where it is most needed.  </p>
          <h2> Education</h2>
          <p><img src="../images/sector7.png" alt="" width="116" height="75" align="left" />A sound education is still the basis of positive future development.  Providing sound education at all levels goes a long way towards the fight to alleviate poverty.  By offering vocational training to youth, they are less likely to become involved in criminal activities, they are given the tools to care for themselves, and they become active participants in rebuilding their nation.  Also, besides the need for adequate training facilities and resources, another area demanding urgent attention is job creation.  </p>
          <h2> Mission, Evangelism en Bible dissemination</h2>
          <p><img src="../images/sector8.png" alt="" width="116" height="75" align="left" />Many organizations that operate from a religious background focus on providing concrete material aid as well as Mission and Evangelism.  The Bible is translated into many different languages and many organizations across the globe support its dissemination.  They also identify a need to support local religious leaders who are often faced with resistance in countries with limited freedom of religious practice.  </p>
          <h2>Intercessor for all your questions and projects</h2>
          <p> <span class="quintessence">Quintessence</span> acts as an intercessor, searching for the best possible solutions for all your questions and projects.  By keeping a close dialogue with you, we aim to find the right people to do the job, short or longer term, from the Netherlands or from abroad.  We have one central goal: to deliver efficient, cost effective work that supports the realisation of your objectives.  </p>
